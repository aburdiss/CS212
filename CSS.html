        <h1>Erlkönig Analysis</h1>
        <h2>Alexander Burdiss</h2>
        <p>In Erlkönig, Schubert utilized the Lied tradition to its 
fullest. Schubert enhanced the meaning of Goethe’s poem and added more 
to the story than was capable through words alone. Through ingeniously 
crafted melodies and textures, Schubert is able to set each phrase to 
music perfectly, in an ever changing way. Schubert’s Erlkönig 
beautifully depicts the setting, characters, and their emotions through 
his use of melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic devices.</p>
        <p>Goethe’s poem Erlkönig contains three characters and a 
narrator. The narrator serves to set the scene at the beginning and end.
 In the poem, a young boy and his father ride on horseback through the 
forest as an Elf King tries to lure the young boy away from his father. 
The father doesn’t seem to notice the Elf King until it is too late. 
Although Goethe set the poem in strophic form, Schubert sets the poem 
musically in a through-composed form. By using the through-composed 
style Schubert is able to change the musical style (harmonies, texture, 
tessitura, etc.) depending on the character that is speaking. Schubert 
is also able to show character development and story arc through his use
 of through-composed form. Strophic form would not be able to capture 
this effect, because the characters switch off in the text at irregular 
intervals.</p>
        <p>The piano part of Schubert’s Erlkönig does not function 
strictly as an accompanimental role; rather, it serves the role of 
another character and helps to paint the scene that the characters 
interact with. In mm. 1-14, the repeated triplet figure played in right 
hand depicts the canter of the horse, and the chord changes set an eerie
 mood, akin to the dark, misty, and windy forest in which this scene 
takes place. The rising and falling melodic pattern played by the left 
hand in m. 2 depicts the wind blowing through the forest. This ‘wind’ is
 most present in the sections where the narrator is speaking, but is 
mostly forgotten about in the central action of the poem where the 
characters exist. The piano plays the independent role of the horse and 
the landscape in this song, and paints clearly in the listener’s mind 
the setting of the scene.</p>
        <p>Different characters are expressed through the use of 
different tessituras and styles of singing. The son character sings in 
the high tessitura, ranging from F4 to Gb5, but favors the higher 
tessitura of his range. When the boy is singing, as in mm. 73-79, the 
piano also favors the higher tessitura, playing the repeated triplet 
pattern from the opening, modulated up a fifth from G to D. The son 
character’s frightened mood is also expressed effectively through the 
music. For example, in m. 58, the Elf king sings in a more relaxed style
 than even the father, trying to entice the son away. In m. 72, the end 
of the Elf King’s phrase is marked at a pianississimo dynamic, and the 
piano abruptly breaks into the repeated triplet theme from the opening 
on an offbeat and at a subito forte dynamic, signaling the entrance of 
the son character. This startling entrance depicts how frightened the 
son character is in this moment.</p>
        <p>The father character sings in the lower tessitura, ranging 
from C4 to D5, and favors the lower tessitura of his range. Schubert 
highlights the natural difference in tessitura between young and adult 
male voices in his characters. The piano also highlights this difference
 in tessitura, following the higher and lower ranges each character 
sings in. The clearest example of this difference happens between mm. 97
 and 111. In m. 105, the measure between the switch in character from 
son to father, the chords in the right hand of the piano descend, and 
the repeated triplet pattern is modulated down a third to match the 
lower tessitura of the father. </p>
        <p>When the Elf King sings, his range spans the complete 
tessitura of the piece, ranging from E4 to G5, not favoring the high or 
low of his range. The Elf King sings in a melismatic style, whereas the 
Father, Son, and Narrator sing in a syllabic style. The piano texture is
 only different when the Elf King sings; the first entrance of the elf 
king is accompanied by a broken triplet pattern. The second time the Elf
 King sings, the piano plays a broken chord accompaniment with a drum 
bass in the left hand. The final time the Elf King sings, he sings in 
the aggravated style of both the father and the son. The Elf King has 
grown frustrated at this point, and has entered the vicinity of the son 
and father symbolically and literally. The lighter style present in the 
earlier entries of the Elf King highlight his evil motives, because he 
is trying to lure the child away from his father by using sweeter, more 
songlike melodies. </p>
        <p>The harmonies of this work also help to showcase each 
character. When the father sings, the mode is generally minor, with a 
few major keyed exceptions. When the son enters, the harmony is 
exclusively diminished. This helps to show how the son is scared, and 
feeling unstable. Every time the Elf King sings, the mode modulates to 
major. This modulation furthers the Elf King’s motives, because he is 
trying to lure the child away by using sweet harmonies and songlike 
melodies.</p>
        <p>In the first two entries, the Elf King makes futile attempts 
to persuade the son to come with him. The first attempt has a moderate 
character with gentle melody, and is in the key of the Relative Major. 
The second attempt has a songlike character with an even sweeter melody,
 and is in the key of C major. The Elf King gets frustrated after 
singing his second phrase, and is more determined by the third phrase to
 capture the son. The third entry of the Elf King starts on a Neapolitan
 Chord. This chord is presented almost as another modulation to major, 
but is in the same minor key the son and father sang in prior to his 
entrance. The piano texture does not change for this entrance, and is 
the same texture used during both the son and fathers sections 
throughout the piece. By having the Elf King enter the third time in the
 same key as the son and father, and with the same texture, it is as if 
the Elf King has entered the same realm as the son and father, and is 
able to finally capture the son by doing so. Through these subtle 
changes in texture, mode, and mood, Schubert creates a heightened sense 
of drama that moves the plot forward and enhances the meaning of the 
text in a profound way, creating a work of music that can move the 
listener emotionally and intellectually. </p>
        <p>The song ends with a line sung without accompaniment. This 
setting of the text “In his arms the child lay dead” stands out from the
 rest of the song because of its lack of accompaniment, and captures the
 very depressed and lonely emotion present in the text. The words “lay 
dead” are also set apart from the rest of the phrase by a piano chord. 
By suspending the phrase “lay dead” schubert is able to create one last 
bit of suspense by making the listener wait for a conclusion to even the
 final phrase. The final cadence played by the piano is concise and 
appropriate. It helps to underline the crudity and gravity of the 
situation, rather than trying to extend the feeling of grief. The abrupt
 ending is much more fitting to the child’s abrupt death.</p>
        <p>Schubert manages to bring the characters in Erlkönig to life 
in a way that enhances the meaning of Goethe’s original poem. By using 
range, texture, and by treating the piano as an independent voice, 
Schubert is able to paint a musical soundscape that immerses the 
listener in a windy, terror filled landscape, and effectively and 
profoundly tells the narrative of the Elf King. Schubert took the words 
of Goethe, and created something much more artistic and expressive. In 
the words of Heinrich Heine, “Where words leave off, music begins”.</p>

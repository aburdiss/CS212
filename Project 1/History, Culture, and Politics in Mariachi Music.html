    <h1>History, Culture, and Politics in Mariachi Music</h1>
    <section id="introduction">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Music has been around arguably as long as humans and each style
 of music has roots that trace back theoretically as far. The mariachi 
music native to Mexico is no exception. Mariachi Music has a rich 
cultural history which fits in with the socio-political environment that
 is Mexico itself. Mariachi music has come from a variety of sources, 
both past and present, and is a genre that seems to change with each new
 generation. From its inception in the rural areas of Mexico, 
incorporating Indigenous Heritage, European harmony and instruments, and
 African rhythms and instruments, mariachi has had a very popular 
history and is one of the most unique and identifiable styles of music 
around the world. It serves as a source of national identity to some and
 is present in many different cultural rituals including weddings, 
birthdays, baptisms, and parties. Mariachi music, as a symbol of Mexican
 culture, is unrivaled by every other country in the west.</p>
      <p>In this paper, I will address how mariachi music has been used 
in foreign contexts to symbolize a stereotypical view of Mexicans and 
Mexican culture, and also how mariachi music can be used to increase 
graduation rates for minority students, and to provide a place of refuge
 for minority groups around the world, as a source for national pride 
and symbol of cultural heritage. As a stereotype, mariachi music has 
been used in many foreign films to symbolize the ‘Latino lover,’ or the 
‘immigrant worker.' These kinds of contexts do not embrace the true 
meaning of the music and don't always use the music in the right 
contexts. In the right context, mariachi music has an extremely powerful
 effect on people. Its age and traditions are deeply tied to the culture
 of the Mexican people and their identities.</p></section>

      <h3>Discussion/Analysis</h3>
      <p>Music has been a part of life in the area we now call Mexico as
 long as history itself. The first kinds of music were by indigenous 
cultures and were largely religious based. "The instruments include many
 idiophones (scraped, struck, and rattled); bodies of membranophones; 
and aerophones, such as ceramic duct globular ﬂutes, duct tubular ﬂutes,
 panpipes, and conch trumpets" (Olsen 2007 15). The music was made using
 idiophones and membranophones of almost infinite variety, some 
cultures, namely the Maya and Inca, developed larger ensembles that may 
have rivaled traditional western classical orchestras in terms of size 
and complexity. These native ensembles arguably had a larger impact on 
their societies than western classical ensembles, because there was more
 of a communal approach to the music, and music was very essential to 
almost every part of their culture, including harvest, funerals, 
religious purposes, and communal entertainment (Giovanni, et. al. 2019).
 Music was finely woven into the cultures and lives of the indigenous 
people, arguably more so than Europeans of the time.</p>
      <p>Because of the Spanish conquest, and their use of African 
slaves, many new cultures and peoples were brought to Mexico around the 
16th century. The African people brought with them many different kinds 
of music, and their own cultures and religious beliefs (Palmer 2019). 
Africans were able to reproduce instruments from their home in their new
 landscape, recreating the traditions they were taken away from (Mintz, 
S. et. al.). Their indigenous music was strongly discouraged by their 
Spanish slave masters, but it was allowed when incorporated with western
 traditions, whether in music or in Catholic worship services (Palmer 
2019). Through clever integration, African music was able to prevail 
until the end of slavery.</p>
      <p>The Spanish brought with them most notably their language, 
which still prevails in Mexico to this day. They also brought with them 
Catholicism and all of the musical traditions associated with that. Many
 instruments were also brought over, including the guitar, piano, and 
early brass instruments. Musicians from Europe sought to replace the 
indigenous music that they saw as pagan and began to teach many of their
 slaves and native peoples western classical music. The native peoples 
and African slaves began incorporating these instruments and traditions 
with their own types of music, and new forms of music emerged, many of 
which, including mariachi, are still heard today (Giovanni, et. al. 
2019).</p>
      <p>The cultural history of the Mexican people mirrors the musical 
history of Mexico. Music is inseparable from Culture in modern life, as 
it was for the indigenous people, African people, and Europeans. 
Mariachi music, consequently, is inseparable from Mexican culture. The 
music itself has had a history that directly parallels the history of 
Mexican people. Mariachi music permeates all aspects of life in Mexico. 
“While most other Latin countries have adopted some version of the 
American ‘Happy Birthday,’ Mexicans sing a mariachi song” (Preston 1996 
A1). Mariachi bands also have a place in traditional marriage 
ceremonies, religious sermons, and other rites of passage (Preston 1996 
A1). “The role of the mariachi as a symbol of Mexican culture is likely 
to remain virtually unchallenged by other types of Mexican music” (Clark
 2005 235). This music is sewn into the fabric of Mexican culture, and 
the culture wouldn’t be the same without the music, just as the music 
wouldn’t be the same without the culture.</p>
      <p>Mariachi music has been a symbol of Mexican heritage since its 
inception, combining the different elements of African, European, and 
Indigenous cultures, however, mariachi music's function in contemporary 
society has changed, depending on its place in the world. "[Mariachi 
music] is symbol and stereotype, ancient and modern, glorified and 
scorned, profession and avocation, a form of musical expression, and a 
way of life" (Sheehy 2016 138). In the United States and Europe, 
mariachi music is often misused in popular films, portraying a racist 
and stereotypical image of Mexicans and their culture, and often only 
use the music to amplify the exoticism of a character or to portray a 
‘Latin Lover' (Koegel 2006 9). In the wrong context such as these, the 
music doesn't serve as a source of pride, and is derogatory in a way, 
exoticizing another culture to try to ‘make a better movie'. Many 
Americans aren't ever exposed to people from Mexico, and these films are
 their only exposure to Mexicans and their culture.</p>
      <p>Not aiding to educational purposes, many Americans' exposure to
 mariachi music happens only through media, as described above, or in 
Mexican restaurants. In this context, the people running the restaurant 
play mariachi music (or a similar genre of Mexican music) to try to make
 the dinner-goers ‘feel more like they are in Mexico'. In this context, 
the music is also serving to exoticize a culture, but those running the 
restaurant usually play this music themselves. They are exoticizing 
their own culture to make a profit. Although the music is still serving 
to create a feeling of ‘somewhere else' in this context and can be seen 
as a negative use, it is marginally better in this situation because the
 people who play it know what they are doing.</p>
      <p>Although mariachi music serves a derogatory function in many 
American contexts, it has also been used in different contexts to serve 
as a source of pride for many Mexican-Americans, or Mexicans living in 
America. Many high schools and colleges across the United States have 
begun to implement mariachi ensembles as a part of their curriculum. 
This serves as a large source of pride for many Mexican Students, and 
increases their sense of belonging, showing them that their culture is 
valued too. Schools in San Diego implemented a mariachi program "as a 
deterrent to student drop-out" (Clark 2005 232). These programs are 
starting to become more common, especially in the American Southwest. By
 incorporating this music into the curriculum, graduation rates for 
Latino students raise, and these students gain a sense of purpose from 
playing music but aren't bound western classical music. They are free to
 have pride in their own culture.</p>
      <p>Mariachi music can have positive, healing qualities in the 
world, increasing graduation rates, providing burnt out citizens with a 
place of refuge, or it can serve stereotypical ‘exotic’ purposes if used
 in the wrong context. However, with the growing population of Mexicans 
in the United States, awareness of Mexican culture is growing rapidly. 
Mariachi has firmly established itself in the United States as a 
national and cultural symbol and will continue to be a source of pride 
for Mexicans, no matter its treatment by Americans or other ethnic 
groups. "Mariachi music has transitioned from its humble origins in 
rural Mexico to become an iconic representation of the Mexican people, 
within both Mexico and the United States" (Clark 2005 227).</p>
      <p>Music in Mexico started with the Indigenous peoples. “The 
instruments include many idiophones (scraped, struck, and rattled); 
bodies of membranophones; and aerophones, such as ceramic duct globular 
ﬂutes, duct tubular ﬂutes, panpipes, and conch trumpets. In central 
Mexico [sic] are similar musical instruments plus more elaborate tubular
 ﬂutes with ﬂared or disk-shaped distal ends that represent ﬂowers or 
perhaps the sun” (Olsen 2007 15). The owners of these types of musical 
instruments were most likely rulers or religious leaders. We do not know
 exactly what this music sounded like, but we can make guesses based on 
the type of instruments and contemporary performances by Indigenous 
peoples, inspired by the oral tradition of their ancestors.</p>
      <p>Son music was one of the first kinds of music that spawned in 
Mexico after the Spanish colonization. It has its roots from Baroque 
Spanish dance music, but this influence diminished gradually over time. 
African rhythms also played a large part in the shaping of this genre, 
and one can hear styles from the Caribbean as well. This music could 
only have formed where it did: in Veracruz, Mexico (Loza 1982). The 
traditional Son music is still alive in Mexico, but it began to be 
differentiated from mariachi music through distinct and intentional 
changes to the music, that served the needs of the people.</p>
      <p>Mariachi music, in its proper form, started in the countryside,
 by rural performers. It did not begin as the “It was said to be a music
 of the country people. Mariachi was, ‘a version of the traditional 
Spanish theatrical orchestra containing violins, guitars, and a harp'. 
Nowadays, mariachi groups can contain as many as 20 people. Back then, 
many of these mariachi ensembles were small and not very well-known" 
(Kiang 2014). These musical groups gained popularity because of their 
cultural relevance. This music plays a special role in the lives of many
 Mexicans. Mariachi music is a symbolic representation of cultural 
heritage and is a strong symbol of Mexican nationalism.</p>
      <p>The mariachi ensemble owes much to its predecessor: son music. 
There were no trumpets and there was a larger emphasis on chordophones 
and membranophones. Throughout time the ensemble changed both in style 
and in instrumentation. The traditional mariachi ensemble gave way to a 
more utilitarian approach. The harp was left out because it had mobility
 problems. A pair of trumpets were added, and a couple of chordophones 
adopted. The sound of the modern mariachi ensemble took shape over time.
 "[Mariachi music] originated as a regional style in Jalisco, Western 
Mexico, and grew to international stature, becoming a symbol of Mexican 
folk music" (Harpole 2009 4). Various changes to the instrumentation, 
styles, and sounds of mariachi music were made to help breathe a new 
life into the music. These changes were cultural and served the needs of
 the people, and this would be impossible without inevitable change over
 time.</p>
      <p>Mariachi music has always been gendered because men have 
historically been the performers of mariachi music. This doesn't mean 
that mariachi music has been exclusively performed by men, and more 
recently, changes have been happening and the music has become more 
progressive, and more and more women are beginning to find a place in 
the mariachi scene. Many women have found success and fame performing 
mariachi music, by providing a new timbre and a chance to expand a 
performing group’s repertoire (Marrujo 2018). Women have had a rich 
history of performing in mariachi groups, starting in the early 20th 
century. Around the 1940s, the first all-women mariachi groups started 
to form, and many became international sensations. Rebecca Gonzalez 
became famous for her role in Los Camperos de Nati Cano. The all-female 
mariachi group ‘Mariachi Mujer 2000' became the first group, male or 
female, to win a Grammy. Women have played a non-trivial role in 
mariachi music, modernizing the genre, and bringing a new, diverse 
perspective to the music.</p>
      <p>Other styles of music have also been influential in 
diversifying mariachi music and vice versa. In the west, “the Mexican 
composer, Blas Galindo, [wrote] a symphonic score entitled Mariachi 
[sic]. Aaron Copland uses the mariachi type of harmony and tone color in
 his El Salon Mexico" (Slonimsky 1945 219). Galindo's "Sones de 
Mariachi" is written for a traditional large western orchestra, and 
incorporates actual mariachi melodies in its score, providing an 
exciting and entertaining piece for orchestra goers. Many other 
composers from Mexico used traditional Mexican styles in their 
compositions, especially mariachi music. These composers were trying to 
incorporate their own nationality and cultural pride in their music. 
Aaron Copland incorporates mariachi music into his work ‘El Salon 
Mexico.'</p>
      <p>Music isn't just an auditory phenomenon. Every type of music 
contains within it a living history of where it came from. Mariachi 
music to this day carries with it the sophistication of western harmony,
 the spirit of indigenous peoples, and the rhythms of Africa. Without 
any of these cultural roots, mariachi music wouldn't be able to exist 
today, and without the cultural ties that these roots bring with them, 
the music wouldn't have nearly the same effect and appeal today as it 
does. "Mariachi music has transitioned from its humble origins in rural 
Mexico to become an iconic representation of the Mexican people, within 
both Mexico and the United States" (Clark 2005 227). These changes were 
slow, and over the course of time, serving the needs of the people and 
growing with them, changing to accommodate whatever they saw fit. 
Mariachi continues to grow to this day and is still changing: appealing 
to the next generation while still maintaining connections to its deep 
cultural roots.</p>
      <p>Mariachi music has been a strong symbol of Mexican nationalism 
and cultural pride since its inception. It serves a plethora of people 
in this way and is seen as such by many people in the outside world. It 
has the power to connect people, comfort people who have been displaced 
from their home, raise morale, and improve student performance. Mariachi
 music, although it has a long history of cultural roots, is very much a
 living music, and continues to change and adapt to new peoples and 
modern cultures. It has been doing this since its creation, and this is a
 good thing. It keeps the heritage alive and provides a useful, modern 
medium for today's youth to express themselves through while still 
maintaining connections to the past.</p></section>
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Although mariachi music is so powerful and important to so many
 people, it can also be misused and act like a racist symbol for exotic 
and foreign culture and a group of people, although this ‘foreign' group
 of people are our next-door neighbors. When in the right context, 
mariachi music can be a very powerful force for good in the world, but 
in the wrong hands, can be a very damaging and offensive tool, 
exoticizing and distancing a whole culture for entertainment or 
capitalist purposes. Mariachi music is a music for the people, and will 
remain as such as long as it keeps a modern perspective, and stays 
relevant to those it is for.</p></section>
